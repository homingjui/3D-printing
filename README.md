# 3D-printing
This is a little project for recording the process of 3D printing.  
Taking photo automatic every layers to make time lapse video.

## my work
1.  Understanding how my Wired Timer Remote Control [TC-252](https://www.pixelhk.com/en/product/TC-252-3) works.

2.  The release button is work with two-stage pressing.  
First stage is for camera focus and fire next.  
Therefore, it needs to short two connection to ground to make the controler send a signal for take a shot.

3.  Wired the camera controller to the relay whitch connected to laser signal output port.
Because that laser signal port is already design on this 3D printer controller board, and can easily set by G-code.
